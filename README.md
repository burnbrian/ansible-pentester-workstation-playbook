Pentester Workstation Playbook (PWP) uses Ansible to install and configure a vanilla Ubuntu (18.04-22.04) system with my preferred engagement tooling. I use this playbook to quickly configure a new virtual machine inside of VMware or Proxmox. This doesn't automate everything (yet) but I'm slowly adding functionality.

While creating this playbook I took strong inspiration from [Ippsec](https://ippsec.rocks), [Jeff Geerling](https://jeffgeerling.com), and [Jay LaCroix](https://www.jaylacroix.com/).

## Example Playbook Output

## Setup with Python-venv

Ansible has several local system requirements. You can install these requirements on root or with the python virtual environment module. Below is an example setup:

* Install python dependencies `sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip git`
* Clone this repo with `git clone <url>`
* Create python venv with `python3 -m venv ansible-venv`
* Source venv with `source ansible-venv/bin/activate`
* Install pips `pip3 install ansible jmespath pexpect defusedxml psutil`
* Install galaxy requirements `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`
* Run the playbook with `ansible-playbook main.yml --tags=pentest,vscode,social,appearance,burpsuite`

Alternatively you can install on root by ignoring the virtual environment steps.

## Running with Specific Ansible Tags

You can choose which configuration tasks you would like to perform with tags. Currently available tags are: `appearance`, `social`, `pentest`, `burpsuite`, and `vscode`. As an example I usually run `ansible-playbook main.yml --tags=pentest,vscode,social,appearance,burpsuite` when configuring a system.
